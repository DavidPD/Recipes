Well... it's usually on the box of lasagna noodles... But here's what I do.

1 box lasagna noodles,
1 large jar of prego or similar,
package of swiss cheese,
package of mozzarella cheese,
1 - 24 oz. 2% or whole cottage cheese,
1-2 eggs,
Get an extra jar of prego, just in case.
1 pound hamburger cooked with half a chopped onion.

You can start your water boiling, then start cooking the hamburger, and stir together egg/cottage cheese. All components should be ready before you start layering. Get the leanest hamburger possible and you won't have to drain the grease.

Drain, add jar of prego. Cook noodles until al dente...drain and pour cold water over enough so they don't stick while you assemble. While they are cooking, whisk 1-2 eggs in a medium size bowl, stir in cottage cheese, and a handful of mozzarella. I also put in fresh or dried parmesan and fresh or dried herbs if I want...like parsley.

In your long casserole dish, put a little sauce in the bottom. Layer 3 noodles side by side. Put 1/3 of cottage cheese mixture and 1/3 of sauce...I kind of pat it down, but you don't have to get precise about it. Then 3 more noodles, then cottage cheese, sauce, noodles, cottage cheese, sauce. End with noodles. I like to put a little sauce on top of the top noodles. And some mozzarella cheese.

Spray some foil with nonstick spray before you cover the dish. That keeps the cheese from sticking.

NOW...extra... You can layer in more mozzarella. And on one layer, I put 4 slices of swiss cheese.

You can assemble and freeze. Or assemble and put in the fridge and bake the next day. Bake until bubbly and hot. About 45 minutes at 350 unless it's been in the fridge.
