Teriyaki chicken recipe:

Ingredients:
Cooking oil
3-4 boneless skinless chicken thighs, sliced into small chunks
brocolli
2 bell peppers, sliced
1 large onion (or 2 small), sliced
2 carrots, chopped into thin pieces

for the sauce:
Roughly 1/2 cup soy sauce
1 Tbsp honey or brown sugar
1 Tbsp minced garlic
1 Tbsp minced ginger
1 Tbsp mirin or sake (optional)
1 Tbsp corn starch

Directions:
To make the sauce mix all the ingredients except the corn starch together in a small bowl. Then mix 1 Tbsp corn starch with about 1 Tbsp water and stir that mixture into the sauce.

Heat 1-2 Tbsp oil in a pan over medium heat, saute brocolli and carrots a little first, then pour in a little less than 1/4 cup water to steam the veggies. Once the water has evaporated let the pan heat up again and then add the rest of your veggies. Saute the veggies until they're still a little crunchy and then set aside in a large bowl. Add a little more oil to the pan and brown the meat over medium highish heat. Once the meat is browned, add the vegatables back to the pan and pour the sauce mixture in. Stir the sauce in with the stir fry and let it simmer until it starts to thicken (about 5-10 minutes). And then you're done!
